PC Software:
* added Config Bytes write for PIC18 family (for the moment, just some firmwares can handle this option - look at http://tinypicbootload.sourceforge.net/tested_devices_pic.html)
* added the possibility to manually enter weird "baud rates" (like 111456) in order to adapt the baud rate to the new PIC speed (if modified by the Config Bytes Write)
* in debug tab a "special baud rates" group was added to calculate weird baud rates as a fonction of old baudrate, old and new PIC frequencies. This calculated baudrate is automatically added to the "Baud Rate" combobox.
* 'added baudrates to the "Baud Rate" combobox' are saved in "config.ini"
* progress bar display modification: restart from 0 at each new process (e.g. EEPROM write, Boot Flash write, Program Flash write, etc...)
* changed "config.ini" loading process in order to keep new versions of "TinyBootloader+" compatibles with older "config.ini". 
* added "Erase EEPROM" option
* bug fix: only write the EEPROM bytes which are present in the "hex" file. Now, leave other data in EEPROM untouched
* bug fix: write EEPROM byte even if it equals 0xFF
* bug fix: for PIC16 normal and enhanced families, if there are "User ID" bytes in hex file they will be discarded (not written) instead of displaying "Error: hex file too large, writing bootloader firmware!!!".
* bug fix: some PIC16 hex files aren't detected as PIC18 ones anymore.

v0.8.0 (july 2013):
-------------------

ATtiny firmwares: 
* modification of all firmwares to handle the new device answer type (see PC software below).

ATmega firmwares: 
* added firmware for ATmega8
* added firmware for ATmega48
* added firmware for ATmega88
* added firmware for ATmega168A
* added firmware for ATmega328P

PIC10-12-16-18 firmwares:
* firmware improvements for PIC12F1501, PIC12F1822 and PIC12F1840
* firmware improvements for PIC16F1454-1455-1459, PIC16F1503-1507, PIC16F1508-1509-1512-1513-1516-1517-1518-1519-1526-1527, PIC16F1782-1783-1784-1786-1787-1788-1789, PIC16F1823-1824-1825-1826-1827-1828-1829-1847, PIC16F1933-1934-1936-1937-1938-1939-1946-1947
* added firmware for PIC18F26K22

PC Software:
* Atmel AVR ATmega devices are now supported (by Dan)!
* family for AVR ATtiny changed from "#A" to "1"
* changed device answer type. Instead of "0xID_device 0x4B" it's now "0xID_device 0xASCII(upper_case_Family_code)". 
    By this way we could have 256 different devices in every family, and not 256 for the whole families.
    Old firmwares are still compatibles with this new device answer type.
* added "family" text box for virtual device in debug tab.
* modifications in "config.ini" to keep trace of modification for virtual device in debug tab.
   !!! previous version of "config.ini" file is no more compatible with "Tiny AVR/PIC Bootloader+ v0.7.1" 
    (you just have to erase it, it will be created automaticaly the next time you'll use "Tiny PIC Bootloader+")!!!
* added Help by clicking on [?(F1)] button, or by pressing "F1" key, then click on a control to display its function.
* added "Online Support" link to the forum
* modifications in "piccodes.ini" relative to AVR families.

v0.7.1 (july 2013):
-------------------

PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx Firmware:
* release of a USB CDC (RS232 emulation with USB) version of the firmware for USB capable devices. Beware this version is very huge (24kB) if compared to UART version (4kB). With full compiler optimizations, it can be 16kB.
As at startup virtual COM will be available for only 1 seconde, the best way to get its number is to use [Search COM] in "Tiny AVR/PIC Bootloader+" and look at the new COM that has appeared.

PC Software:
* Drag & Drop allowed. If in the objects put on the application's window they are ".hex" or ".eep" (EEPROM for AVR) files then:
            - add the first one to "listHexFiles" list view and select it 
            - write it to the device
* added in debug tab, displaying of raw data during communication with a device.
* can select if flash program memory must be programmed or not in the device (allow to write only EEPROM)
* modifications in "config.ini" to keep trace if flash program memory must be writen or not.
    !!! previous version of "config.ini" file is no more compatible with "Tiny AVR/PIC Bootloader+ v0.7.1" 
    (you just have to erase it, it will be created automaticaly the next time you'll use "Tiny PIC Bootloader+")!!!
* can open EEP (EEPROM file for AVR) or HEX files. If EEP file is choosen, the program will try to search the corresponding HEX file.
* bug fix: .EEP file wrongly displayed when "show hex file during transfert" is checked

v0.7.0.2 (july 2013):
--------------------

ATtiny firmwares: 
* bug fix for ATtiny4313
* firmware improvement for ATtiny2313A

* added PIC12F753 firmware

PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx Firmware:
* changed "#pragma config FCKSM" to enble Clock Switching
* added a define: BOOTLOADER_SIZE, for easier reading of the code and future developments.

PC Software:
* bug fix: for PIC18 family, if there are "User ID" bytes in hex file they will be discarded (not written) instead of displaying "Error: hex file too large, writing bootloader firmware!!!".
* bug fix: when in "Debug" tab "Show answer during [Check Device]" is checked, now display answer even when only 1 byte is received. 
* now [Check Device] is not stopped by a not opened COM (could be usefull if COM is only available during the test but not at its start) 
* modifications in "piccodes.ini" relative to changed firmware.

v0.7.0.1 (july 2013):
--------------------

ATtiny firmwares:

v0.6.5.1 (may 2013):
--------------------

PIC10-12-16-18 firmwares:
* bug fixes for PIC16F720/721 and PIC16F818/819 devices from Dan: http://www3.hp-ez.com/hp/bequest333/page30

v0.6.5 (may 2013):
--------------------

Docs / Web site:
* "Tested devices" page updated.

PIC10-12-16-18 firmwares:
* many new firmwares for midrange (PIC12F and 16F) devices from Dan: http://www3.hp-ez.com/hp/bequest333/page30
  Look at "Tested devices" doc/web page for a complete listing.
* modification of all PIC18 firmwares for EEPROM write compatibility with "Tiny Pic Bootloader+" >= v0.6.5 (unlike original version, works even if EEPROM > 256 bytes).
    !!! previous firmwares of PIC18 devices aren't compatible with "Tiny PIC Bootloader+" EEPROM write !!!
	If you don't need EEPROM write, then old PIC18 firmwares can still be used with "Tiny Pic Bootloader+" >= v0.6.5
* CFG write code commented in all PIC18 firmwares, because it's not planned to use it with "Tiny Pic Bootloader+" and with modifications for EEPROM write some firmwares get bigger than 100 words.
* Errors were corrected in some PIC18 firmwares. Now, all PIC18 "asm" sources were tested and compile flawlessly.

PC Software:
* modifications in "transfertHexToArray" to handle some PIC12 and PIC16 with Configuration words at 0x8007 and not at 0x2007.
* added EEPROM write for normal (e.g. PIC16F874A, PIC16F886, etc) and enhanced (e.g. PIC12F1840, PIC16F1823, etc) midrange families.
* added EEPROM write for PIC18 family (unlike original version, works even if EEPROM > 256 bytes).
    !!! previous firmwares of PIC18 devices aren't compatible with "Tiny PIC Bootloader+" EEPROM write
    (you must use PIC18 firmwares' sources from the archive of "Tiny Pic Bootloader+" >= v0.6.5) !!!
	If you don't need EEPROM write, then old PIC18 firmwares can still be used with "Tiny Pic Bootloader+" >= v0.6.5
* added the possibility to use a virtual PIC device (only usefull for PC software developpers).
* modifications in "config.ini" to keep trace of the virtual PIC.
    !!! previous version of "config.ini" file is no more compatible with "Tiny PIC Bootloader+ v0.6.5" 
    (you just have to erase it, it will be created automaticaly the next time you'll use "Tiny PIC Bootloader+")!!!
* added "Abort" button to interrupt the current operation (i.e. auto conf com, write or check pic).
* modification in "auto COM conf" algorithm: at first try the latest COM and Baudrate configuration used.
* added "auto" option in command line, in order to have automatic COM configuration even with command line: 
       tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\folder 1\folder etc\file name.hex" [COMx [BaudRate]|auto])
  example: tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\test file.hex" auto
* modification of "piccodes.ini" for the many new midrange devices added.

v0.6.4 (may 2013):
--------------------

Docs / Web site:
* changed web site layout.
* "Quickstart" page complete.

PIC10-16-18 firmwares:
* new 100 words firmware for PIC10F322 (from Dan: http://www3.hp-ez.com/hp/bequest333/page30)
  The 132 words firmware version is no more included with TinyBootloader+.

PC Software:
* command line: added COMnum and baudrate.
  syntax: 
    tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\folder 1\folder etc\file name.hex" [COMx [BaudRate]]
  If 'COMx' or 'BaudRate' aren't passed in arguments, the previuos option used in the GUI (stored in the "config.ini" file) will be used.
  Examples: tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\test file.hex" COM8 9600
            tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\test file.hex" com8
            tinypicbootloader+.exe "c:\test file.hex"
* RS232 power supply (based on Dan's idea and schematic): DTR and RTS can be used to power the PIC device directly with RS232 port (only during programming!!!). These options are in the debug tab.
     Schematic for use this capacity is given in "Tiny PIC Bootloader +" web site:
          http://tinypicbootload.sourceforge.net/hardware_connection.html
     Note: As the PIC device is only powered during programming, then it works as automatic reset.
* modifications in "config.ini" to keep trace of DTR/RTS powering.
     !!! previous version of "config.ini" file is no more compatible with "Tiny PIC Bootloader+ v0.6.4" (you just have to erase it, it will be created automaticaly the next time you'll use "Tiny PIC Bootloader+")!!!
* modification for PIC16F88 in "piccodes.ini":
      $33, B, 16F 88, $2000, $100, default, 64,

v0.6.3.1 (april 2013):
--------------------

Docs / Web site:
* "Hardware Connections" page complete.

PIC10-16-18 firmwares:
* added PIC10F322 (100 words and 132 words) firmwares (from Dan: http://www3.hp-ez.com/hp/bequest333/page30)
  Dan told me that 132 words firmware is more stable. But, you can try both.

PC Software:
* added IdTypePIC for PIC10F322 (100 words and 132 words) firmwares in "piccodes.ini"

v0.6.3 (april 2013):
--------------------

PC Software:
* modifications in "configureTransfert" function in 'B' family: 
     assembly code changes for "goto bootloader_address" and memory page selection. 
     Now it can handle different bootloader sizes (not only 100 words), and any max flash memory.

PIC16 and PIC18 firmwares:
* "icdpictypes.inc" file is no more used.
     #include "user_pic_device.inc", IdTypePIC and #define max_flash are now put in firmwares ".asm" source code.
	 All firmaware source files in "Tiny PIC Bootloader +" archive have been modified in accordance. 

PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx Firmware:
* in addition to the bootloader firmware linker for 512KB, now they are linkers for 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256KB devices.

v0.6.2.1 (april 2013):
----------------------

PC Software:
* bug fix: code simplifications for PIC16Fxxx family in "hexToArray" function, was a very bad idea! Bootloader can't work anymore with this family! Use this new version if you use PIC16 devices!!!

v0.6.2 (april 2013):
--------------------

PC Software:
* "piccodes.ini" modified to add PIC16F874 and PIC16F877
* added some comments in code
* some code simplifications for PIC16Fxxx family in "hexToArray" function 
* works even if the letter for PIC family in "piccodes.ini" is in upper or lower case
* every mumeric value in "piccodes.ini" can be in hexa (starting with '$') or in decimal (without '$')
* there is two new properties in "piccodes.ini": 'bootloader size' and 'transfert block size'.
    You SHOULD live then as 'default', but if you want to tweak the bootloader you can change them in accordance to your needs, at your own risks (you can erase the bootloader firmware in the device).
    !!! previous version of "piccodes.ini" file is no more compatible with "Tiny PIC Bootloader + v0.6.2" !!!

PIC16 firmwares:
* projects for the old PIC16F874 and PIC16F877 were created.
* bootloader tested on PIC16F874 and PIC16F877

PIC16 and PIC18 firmwares:
* definitions for PIC16F874 and PIC16F877 were added to "icdpictypes.inc"

v0.6.1 (febuary 2013):
----------------------

PC Software:
* bug fix: works even if the ".hex" file is in upper or lower case.
* 'jump to bootloader' modification for ".hex" files generated by mikroC32.

PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx Firmware:
* bug fix: now erase program flash AND BOOT FLASH, as with PIC32: writing data on a non erased address will write a random value (if writed data is different from the stored one, if it's the same then write is OK).

v0.6 (january 2013):
--------------------

PC Software:
* PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx family (with normal ".ld" OR with special ".ld" for boot programs of Microchip HID Bootloader) (firmware must be >= v0.6)
* warning if size of hex to program can overwrite bootloader program (i.e. > (maxMemPos - bootloader size))
* bug fix: can transfer more than 64KB 
* changed in "piccodesIniFile" and "configIniFile" path initialisation '\' to '/' for linux-mono portage compatibility

PIC32MX3xx_to_7xx Firmware:
* place bootloader at the end of the flash program memory
* work with normal ".ld" file and with special ".ld" file used for Microchip HID Bootloader
