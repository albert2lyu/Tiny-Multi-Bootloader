    //This section is the set of definitions required by the MCHPFSUSB
    //  framework.  These definitions tell the firmware what mode it is
    //  running in, and where it can find the results to some information
    //  that the stack needs.
    //These definitions are required by every application developed with
    //  this revision of the MCHPFSUSB framework.  Please review each
    //  option carefully and determine which options are desired/required
    //  for your application.
